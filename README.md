🚗 Multimodal Driver Authentication Framework

🔍 Overview

This repository contains the implementation and synthetic dataset for our Adaptive Multimodal Driver Authentication Framework, designed for intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

The framework integrates gait, face, and voice biometrics within a secure, adaptive learning architecture to ensure reliable, contactless, and continuous driver verification.
The system is motivated by the limitations of unimodal authentication (e.g., spoofing attacks, environmental noise) and introduces:

•	🧍 Gait Recognition via wearable IMUs and LSTM modeling
•	🙂 Facial Recognition via deep CNN feature extraction
•	🎤 Voice Authentication using MFCCs and recurrent modeling
•	🔄 Adaptive Fusion Strategy that dynamically reweights modalities based on session reliability
•	📜 Secure Log-Based Feedback Loop for explainability and tamper-evident accountability

📑 Key Features
•	Real-time authentication across gait, face, and voice inputs
•	Adaptive modality reweighting for improved robustness
•	Session-wise trust grading with log-based adaptation
•	Resistance against spoofing attacks (voice replay, facial photo, gait imitation)
•	Synthetic dataset included for reproducibility
